# Pet Adoption Application

## Project Summary
This project aims to develop a web application that helps connect potential adopters with available pets in shelters. The platform will allow users to browse adoptable pets, filter them by specific attributes such as species, breed, age, and size, and express interest in adopting them. The goal is to simplify the pet adoption process by providing detailed pet profiles, images, and contact options for shelters. By providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface, this application will facilitate better connections between potential adopters and shelters. The ability to search, filter, and save favorite pets will improve user engagement, while the inclusion of an inquiry form ensures a seamless communication process with shelters.


## Description
The pet adoption app will serve as an online platform where shelters can list adoptable pets, and users can search for pets that match their preferences. Users will be able to search for pets based on species (dogs, cats, etc.), breed, age, size, and other characteristics. The application will help increase the adoption rate of animals by providing an easy-to-use interface and a streamlined adoption inquiry process.This application seeks to bridge the gap between shelters and individuals looking to adopt pets by digitizing the search process. Through a structured listing and filtering system, adopters will be able to quickly identify suitable pets, reducing the time and effort needed to find a match.

## Creative Component
To enhance user experience, we will incorporate the following simple but effective features:
- **Favorite Pets List**: Users can save favorite pets and revisit them later.
- **Basic Email Contact Form**: Allows users to send adoption inquiries directly from the pet profile page.
- **Simple Image Carousel**: Displays multiple pet images in an easy-to-navigate format.
These features will significantly enhance the usability of the application by providing personalization, direct communication, and better visualization of available pets. The combination of interactive UI elements and structured information presentation ensures a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

## Usefulness
This application benefits both shelters and adopters:
- **Shelters**: Can list and manage adoptable pets, increasing visibility.
- **Adopters**: Can find pets matching their preferences without visiting multiple shelters.
- **Comparison to Existing Solutions**: While platforms like Petfinder exist, our app will be more **localized** and include an improved search/filter system.
By providing a user-centric experience tailored to specific adoption needs, this application will increase the efficiency of pet adoptions. The platform's streamlined design, enhanced search features, and direct communication options set it apart from existing alternatives, making it a valuable tool for both shelters and adopters.

## Realness (Data Sources)
We will use a real dataset of adoptable pets containing details such as:
- **Animal ID, Name, Type, Breed, Age, Size, Color, Sex**
- **Date of Intake, Shelter Details, and Image URL**
- **Data Format**: CSV file containing structured attributes.
- **Additional Dataset Possibilities**: We may integrate live pet adoption APIs from shelters.
- **External Dataset Source**: [Adoptable Pets Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/adoptable-pets) - A publicly available dataset with details on adoptable pets, providing additional real-time information.
Using real and well-structured datasets ensures that the application can provide accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive information on adoptable pets. The integration of additional APIs will further enhance the quality of data available, improving the overall reliability of the platform.


## Functionality (CRUD & Search)
The application will include the following features:
- **Create**: Shelters can add new pet listings.
- **Read**: Users can view pet profiles.
- **Update**: Shelters can update pet details (e.g., adoption status).
- **Delete**: Remove pets that have been adopted.
- **Search & Filter**: Users can search by pet name, breed, age, size, and species.
These core functionalities ensure that users can easily interact with the application while enabling shelters to manage adoption records efficiently. The combination of CRUD operations and advanced search options creates a flexible and dynamic system for pet adoptions.
