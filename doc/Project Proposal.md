# Pet Adoption Application

## Project Summary
This project aims to develop a web application that helps connect potential adopters with available pets in shelters. The platform will allow users to browse adoptable pets, filter them by specific attributes such as species, breed, age, and size, and express interest in adopting them. The goal is to simplify the pet adoption process by providing detailed pet profiles, images, and contact options for shelters.

## Description
The pet adoption app will serve as an online platform where shelters can list adoptable pets, and users can search for pets that match their preferences. Users will be able to search for pets based on species (dogs, cats, etc.), breed, age, size, and other characteristics. The application will help increase the adoption rate of animals by providing an easy-to-use interface and a streamlined adoption inquiry process.

## Creative Component
To enhance user experience, we will incorporate the following simple but effective features:
- **Favorite Pets List**: Users can save favorite pets and revisit them later.
- **Basic Email Contact Form**: Allows users to send adoption inquiries directly from the pet profile page.
- **Simple Image Carousel**: Displays multiple pet images in an easy-to-navigate format.

## Usefulness
This application benefits both shelters and adopters:\n
- **Shelters**: Can list and manage adoptable pets, increasing visibility.
- **Adopters**: Can find pets matching their preferences without visiting multiple shelters.
- **Comparison to Existing Solutions**: While platforms like Petfinder exist, our app will be more **localized** and include an improved search/filter system.

## Realness (Data Sources)
We will use a real dataset of adoptable pets containing details such as:\n
- **Animal ID, Name, Type, Breed, Age, Size, Color, Sex**
- **Date of Intake, Shelter Details, and Image URL**
- **Data Format**: CSV file containing structured attributes.
- **Additional Dataset Possibilities**: We may integrate live pet adoption APIs from shelters.

## Functionality (CRUD & Search)
The application will include the following features:\n
- **Create**: Shelters can add new pet listings.
- **Read**: Users can view pet profiles.
- **Update**: Shelters can update pet details (e.g., adoption status).
- **Delete**: Remove pets that have been adopted.
- **Search & Filter**: Users can search by pet name, breed, age, size, and species.

## Low-Fidelity UI Mockup
A basic UI mockup will include:\n
- A homepage displaying available pets.
- A pet profile page with images and details.
- A filtering/search interface.

## Project Work Distribution
Each team member will be responsible for:\n
- **Frontend Development**: UI design, interactive elements, pet gallery (Tongrui Yu)
- **Backend Development**: Database management, API integration, CRUD operations (Wentao Li)
- **Search & Filtering Implementation**: Basic search and filter system (Xin Li)
- **Project Management & Documentation**: Keeping track of progress and ensuring completion (Hanning Lin)
